        <div class="byline">
            <p>By Thalía Noboa Lamar</p>
        </div>
        <p>"We want legal abortions, so we don’t die!" This has been the demand of the National
            Campaign for the Right to Legal, Safe, and Free Abortions Alliance in Argentina since 2005.</p>
            <p>The same year, the National Campaign leaders presented the first bill to the Argentine
            Chamber of Deputies advocating for access to a legal procedure, for all women, up to 14
            weeks of pregnancy.</p> <p>In the last 13 years, around 305 civic groups, organizations, and public
            figures have joined the National Campaign. Activists adopted a green scarf as a symbol of
            their cause. Worn as a bandana or around the wrist, it’s an identifier of what they call the
            Green Wave movement.</p>
 
        
        <p> In 2018, the National Campaign submitted another bill that sparked national debates. Amid
            the heated discussions, Línea Peluda was created.</p> <p> Línea Peluda, which means “a hairy line”
            in English, is a collective of Argentine illustrators that uses Instagram as a tool for pro-choice
            activism. “We chose Instagram because it’s free and massive,” explained one of the
            collective’s co-founders, who preferred to remain anonymous. </p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="written_word/LP-1.png" alt="Línea Peluda’s Instagram profile." class="large-image">
                <figcaption>Línea Peluda’s Instagram profile.</figcaption>
    
            </div>
<p></p>
           <p> The collective was named after an illustration technique called the hairy line technique. It is a
            line that has been drawn over and over again —resulting in a jagged, feathery appearance.</p>
           <p> But the organizers pushed the envelope deliberately when choosing Línea Peluda as their
            name. They appropriated the term hairy, used by feminism detractors in Latin America as a
            synonym to ugly, angry, irrational, or “femi-nazis”.</p>

            <p>  Many of the group’s members say their medium of choice is illustration. “It 's accessible and
                easy to share.</p> <p>Very few people will read long academic papers about the same topic,”
                explains Sofía Rolo, a sociologist and a Línea Peluda collaborator from Tierra del Fuego,
                Argentina. Although visual language is also multilayered and prone to differing
                interpretations, Sofía says, “you don't have to be an intellectual to understand a drawing.”</p>
            
<p>Every illustrator had fans that leveraged Línea Peluda. With over 45,000 followers, more
    than 500 illustrations uploaded on the aaccount, and hundreds of shares per post, Línea
    Peluda’s Instagram page has become a digital green wave in and of itself.</p>

<p class="subtitle">How it started</p>
            
         <p> In Argentina, the government only authorizes women to terminate a pregnancy that was
            related to rape or has resulted in life-risking complications. However, those possibilities are
            now in danger after the country’s vice president, Gabriela Michetti, claimed that she wouldn’t
            decriminalize termination altogether, even for rape-related pregnancies.  </p>
            
        <p>In March 2018, the National Campaign filed another bill to the Chamber of Deputies—for the
            seventh time. For abortion to be legalized, the Chamber of Deputies and then the Senate
            would have to approve the bill. </p> <p> For decades, this issue had been considered politically
            untouchable. This time, however, legislators from different political parties in Argentina
            supported the cause. Activists and supporters’ hopes were high for what appeared to be a
            pivotal step toward legalizing the procedure. </p>
            
          <p>  On June 13, 2018, the Chamber approved the bill—a major success. </p>
            
        <p>But after a thirteen-hour debate on August 9, the Senate rejected the bill. Thirty-seven
            senators voted against it, 31 in favor. Twenty-four of the 37 senators that opposed the bill
            were middle-aged men who belonged to the country’s political elite.
            
        </p>

        <p>The Argentine Congress held weekly public discussions weighing arguments before the
            Senate’s deliberation. The discussions, however, did not remain within Congress’s walls. The
            National Campaign alliance organized civic discussions named Martes Verdes (“Green
            Tuesdays”), across Argentina.</p>
        <p>Actresses, students, poets, teachers, artists, and illustrators organized public gatherings where
            they would chant feminist slogans, draw, and have artistic performances.</p>
            <p>That is where Línea Peluda started. Lia Copelo, a well-known female illustrator in Buenos
                Aires, contacted colleagues that had already published some feminist-oriented work. From
                there on, they gathered outside of Congress every Green Tuesday and continued to be in
                touch through a Whatsapp group chat that, within a day, had 200 members willing to
                collaborate with their creative work.</p>
            <p>From Whatsapp, Línea Peluda jumped to an easier-to-manage Facebook group with over a
                thousand members. Lia and other co-founders published open calls for illustrations related to
                pro-choice activism—and they were instantly met with submissions.</p>

                    <div class="image-container">

                <p></p>


                <p>“The campaign’s success happened because of the
                    democratization of the [art] space,” said Mayra Gidoni, an
                    experienced illustrator from Mar del Plata, Argentina, and a
                    Línea Peluda collaborator. No previous illustration experience
                    was required, only enthusiasm and creativity. Mayra explained,
                    “this allowed people, who were not professional illustrators, to
                    express their ideas about legal abortion in different ways and
                    with different tools.”</p>
        <p>Lucía Cueto, for instance, is a thirty-one-year-old collaborator
            from Buenos Aires. She is a political consultant and reporter.
            Illustrating is not her strong suit, but she felt compelled to submit
            a drawing. She used the famous Star Wars character Yoda as her
            subject.</p> <p>Being a galactic civil war survivor, Yoda became a wise
            truth-bearing voice, a Grand Master; Lucía explained that, now
            that “in Argentina, ideas keep polarizing and clashing, Yoda is
            here, to tell the truth about abortion during this key, historical
            moment.”. Her work resides on the grid next to those of
            well-known Argentinian illustrators, some of whom are even
            design lecturers at universities. At Línea Peluda, said the
            anonymous co-founder, leaders equally value all the pieces sent to the account’s inbox.
            “Technique and proficiency are not our guiding principles,” she said.</p>

    <p>The first illustration was posted on April 12, 2018. Hundreds have followed since. All posts
        include the National Campaign’s hashtag, #AbortoLegalYa, which means “legal abortion
        now”; #SeraLey, or “it will be the law”; and the collective’s name, #LineaPeluda.</p>
    
<p>Línea Peluda’s organizers have translated digital activism into tangible actions. During the
    Green Tuesdays’ rallies, outside of Congress, they asked activists, citizens, and passersby to
    draw an abortion rights-related piece and paste it on the walls. The drawings surrounded the
    four-block building. </p> <p> One group started from Congress’ right facade; another, from the left.
    They circled Congress with green colored drawings that made the building a “beautiful
    open-air gallery”, as Thais Montero, one of Línea Peluda’s organizers, described it. Both
    sides met and hugged. “It was exciting to see ourselves coming closer and closer from
    opposite ends,” said Montero. “We thought we weren’t going to make it.”</p>

<p class="subtitle">Many perspectives, one goal</p>

       
<p>Línea Peluda is an artistic echo of a political cause, a real-life
    answer to the question, Why should art and politics converge?
    To which many members responded with the famed
    second-wave feminist slogan: “Because the personal is
    political.” </p> <p>And as Ámbar Pinto, project ambassador in Mar del
    Plata, put it: art is personal. “Art comes from within just like
    the relationship with our bodies, health, and everything
    regarding reproduction,” Pinto said. Her illustration resonates
    with her answer. It showcases a woman screaming the
    National Campaign’s slogan, ”Legal abortion, now!“ She
    described it as “a scream that comes from within, from the center of the earth.” And, in the
    words of Mayra Gidoni, another project contributor, “art plus communication plus politics is
    a win-win!”</p>


<p>The Green Wave percolated into the rest of Latin America. Feminist protests were held in all
    corners of the region. “The campaign for legalizing abortion in Argentina is considered a
    precedent,” explained Pinto. With the movement's increasing popularity, Línea Peluda started
    to resonate in other Hispanic countries. The project’s administrators noticed the platform had
    reached a vast, unexpected demographic when illustrations from Spain and Chile were
    submitted.</p>


   <p>Feminism, however, is understood, experienced, and advocated from multiple angles. Within
    the group, there are followers and detractors for different approaches, but “our core principle
    [is] we are all feminists,” explained Montero. “At the same time, it’s very difficult to
    reconcile a broad ideology among all,” she added. “Each one of us knows how to live by
    'each own’s feminism.’ In our early stages, we realized that our group’s strength was our
    diversity and how we managed to address it.”</p> 

<p>Although the campaign invokes women’s right to choose, the main argument focuses on the
    public health consequences of the ban and how it disproportionately impacts women in
    poverty. Diana Mangialavori, one of Línea Peluda’s administrators, has been encouraging her
    colleagues to focus on echoing the campaign’s main goal. “It doesn’t matter if you would or
    wouldn’t have an abortion! It’s about the many women that would have one and don't have
    the financial resources for a safe underground procedure, so they die or go to jail… They die
    because they’re poor. It’s the biggest injustice of all.”</p>
<p>Diana also alludes to what in Spanish is named sororidad,
    meaning the sense of women being peers: ”It’s neither
    friendship nor love, it's a partnership. It’s ‘you are my equal,
    you are my ally, we are a group.’"</p>
<p>Martina Villa’s illustration of an otherwise black-and-white,
    anonymous woman wearing a green scarf, like many others,
    portrays this union. “My idea was how this green scarf united
    us all,” she said. “It unites women of different ages and social
    classes, representing empathy and sorority among us. The feminist revolution made us feel
    we are not alone.”</p>

    <p class="subtitle">Making violence visible</p>  


<p>Due to abortion’s illegality, there is no government-approved data on how many women have
    been affected by unsafe, clandestine abortions in Argentina. However, the National
    Campaign’s empirical work throughout the years has led to a non-official estimate: over
    3,000 women have died since 1983 due to insecure, underground abortions.</p>
    <p>For many of the collaborators, feminism has been life-affirming. Lujana Zárate, a
        collaborator from Patagonia, gradually became acquainted with feminism through
        conversations, books, and meetings. “Feminism shed light over a lot of things that have never
        been discussed here, in Argentina,” she said. “There was a time in my life I thought abortion
        meant killing babies! I side-eyed women who had one, but I understood that people have
        different backgrounds and that influences their decision-making. Jujuy, for instance, is one of
        the poorest states in the country, and where [clandestine] abortion rates are the highest.”</p>
<p>It’s difficult to pinpoint how many women in Jujuy have clandestine terminations because of
    the issue’s intrinsic underground character. But gender-based and sexual violence can be
    measured. Plan ENIA Argentina, the National Plan for Child and Adolescent Pregnancy
    Prevention developed by the government, reported in 2017 that every year approximately
    3,000 girls under the age of 15 have a rape-related pregnancy in Jujuy and Tucumán, another
    Argentinian state. Gender-based violence is widespread in the country and is intertwined with
    the abortion ban, since many women and girls who are victims of rape can’t access a safe
    procedure.</p>
<p>Gender-based violence also manifests in other blatant, horrific patterns. Femicides—meaning
    the killing of a woman on account of her gender—are rampant. According to the Observatory
    of Gender-Based Violence, an Argentine grassroots organization, between March and
    September 2019, 164 femicides were registered in the country. By comparison,
    Chile—Argentina's neighbor with cultural kindred—registered 43 femicides that same year.</p>
<p>Lujana Zárate, a Línea Peluda contributor, recalls attending a massive feminist strike in
    response to the nationally discussed femicide case of Lucía Pérez: “a 16-year-old girl was
    raped, impaled, and murdered in the city I live in.” News like is not scarce and has
    strengthened Lujana’s feminist stance. She also mentioned the 2015 femicide of 14-year-old
    Chiara Páez, who was found buried underneath her boyfriend’s house after being beaten to
    death while several weeks pregnant.</p>
<p>Línea Peluda also aims to shed light on other forms of violence toward women – intangible
    aggressions, like information gatekeeping. Diana Mangialavori, a project administrator, had
    underground abortion in 2009.</p> <p>She considers herself lucky because she had the financial
    resources to pay for a relatively safe procedure in a back-alley clinic. However, during the
    procedure, Diana was clueless about what was being done to her body. “The doctor refused to
    answer my questions. He said, ’What am I going to tell you for?!’ We couldn’t access key
    information. Now, young women know at least what Misoprostol is,” Mangialavori said,
    referencing the hexagonal pill used for treating stomach ulcers, but can also induce an
    abortion if inserted into the vaginal canal.</p><p> These pills are carefully distributed by grassroots
    activists or sold on the black market. “I wish I knew all of this back then,” said Mangialavori.
    Línea Peluda has made an effort to educate about Misoprostol through illustrations. “People
    should publicly recognize it exists and is not a dirty word.”</p>

<p class="subtitle">What now?</p>

    <p>The many months of the pro-choice campaign, prior to the Senate’s decree, demanded a deep
        investment of time and emotion. Women united under the Green Wave movement from all
        corners of Argentina.</p>

<p>After waiting long hours on the streets, under the rain, while Senators voted, many activists
    were discouraged by the results. There were rants and tears. It took a toll on a few. “We were
    emotionally drained,” said Montero, a Línea Peluda organizer. “We needed to take some time
    off.” Some of the collective’s original members withdrew from the group out of
    disappointment and because of demanding work and school schedules. However, Montero
    remains confident. “We are now reviving from the ashes,” she said. The group is now
    campaigning for Sexual Education lectures in public schools and the 2020 abortion-rights
    bill—which will be the eighth time Congress has considered it. Línea Peluda’s feed and the
    Green Wave are still active.</p>
